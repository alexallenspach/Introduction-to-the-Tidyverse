In this chapter, you'll learn how to create line plots, bar plots, histograms, and boxplots. You'll see how each plot requires different methods of data manipulation and preparation, and youâ€™ll understand how each of these plot types plays a different role in data analysis. 

1) Line Plots: Useful for showing change over time
2) Bar Plots: Useful for comparing statistics for each of several categories
3) Histograms: Useful for describing the distribution of a one dimensional numeric variable
4) Box Plots: Useful for comparing the distribution of a numeric variable among several categories
